	/** A Video is a Quad with a texture mapped onto it.
	 *
	 *  <p>The Video class is more or less a Starling equivalent of Flash's Video class with attached <em>NetStream</em>.
	 *  The texture is written automatically if not specified otherwise. Never the less you can use other DisplayObjects
	 *  for rendering as well and or handle the drawing and uploading yourself if you want to.</p>
	 * 
	 *  <p><strong>Note:</strong><em>There are no controls for starting/stopping the video source in this class. This has to be done by controlling the
	 *  netStream. If you start/stop the netStream, the video will recieve the Events of the netStream and handle the rest.</em></p>
	 *
	 *  <p>As "Video" inherits from "Quad", you can give it a color. For each pixel, the resulting
	 *  color will be the result of the multiplication of the color of the texture with the color of
	 *  the quad. That way, you can easily tint textures with a certain color. Furthermore flipping is simply done by
	 *  adjusting the vertexData.</p>
	 *
	 *  <p>Uploading textures to the GPU is very expensive. This may be no problem on desktop computers
	 *  but it is a big problem on most mobile devices. Therefore it is very important to chose the right
	 *  resolution and texture size, as well as the method for drawing and uploading.
	 *  If you use Flash 11.8 / AIR 3.8 (-swf-version=21) RectangleTextures are supported if necessary. Versions below will
	 *  always fall back to Textue, so make sure to use the cropping rect parameter to avoid the upload of unused bytes.</p>
