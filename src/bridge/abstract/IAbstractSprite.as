	 * A Sprite is the most lightweight, non-abstract container class.
	 * <p>Use it as a simple means of grouping objects together in one coordinate system, or
	 * as the base class for custom display objects.</p><b>Flattened Sprites</b><p>The <codeph>flatten</codeph>-method allows you to optimize the rendering of static parts of 
	 * your display list.</p><p>It analyzes the tree of children attached to the sprite and optimizes the rendering calls 
	 * in a way that makes rendering extremely fast. The speed-up comes at a price, though: you 
	 * will no longer see any changes in the properties of the children (position, rotation, 
	 * alpha, etc.). To update the object after changes have happened, simply call 
	 * <codeph>flatten</codeph> again, or <codeph>unflatten</codeph> the object.</p><b>Clipping Rectangle</b><p>The <codeph>clipRect</codeph> property allows you to clip the visible area of the sprite
	 * to a rectangular region. Only pixels inside the rectangle will be displayed. This is a very
	 * fast way to mask objects. However, there is one limitation: the <codeph>clipRect</codeph>
	 * only works with stage-aligned rectangles, i.e. you cannot rotate or skew the rectangle.
	 * This limitation is inherited from the underlying "scissoring" technique that is used
	 * internally.</p>
